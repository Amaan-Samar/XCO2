    "## Overview:\n",
    "The GES DISC Application Program Interface (API) is intended for users who prefer to employ our data search and subsetting services using scripts instead of the Web browser interface. The API is a communication protocol that allows users to find the datasets and data granules they need and download any desired subsets. Information is passed back and forth in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "The example code provided below demonstrates three examples on how to use the API to submit an asynchronous request to the GES DISC Subsetting Service in order to obtain subsets of the Modern-Era Retropsective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example presents a complete workflow that uses the 3-dimensional 3-hourly instantaneous data product M2I3NPASM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example uses the 2-dimensional hourly time-averaged product M2T1NXSLV and highlights the steps which need to be modified when changing the specifics of the subset request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example uses the monthly 2-dimensional time-averaged data product M2TMNXAER rather than subsetting sub-daily data as in the first two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "This example code is written in Python3 and requires the following libraries: sys, json, urllib3, certifi, requests, time, http, urllib and getpass. A user must be registered with Earthdata Login and be authorized to access data at the NASA GES DISC. Please read more by visiting [GES DISC data access](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access).\n",

    "### 1) Example #1: MERRA-2 3-Hourly 3-Dimensional Instantaneous Variables (M2I3NPASM) \n",
    "\n",
    "The data product used in this first example is the MERRA-2 product M2I3NPASM which contains instantaneous values at 3-hour intervals of 3-dimensional meteorological fields on pressure levels. Individual data granules for this product are larger than 1 GB and contain data for one day with eight time steps per file. The example shown here will perform subsetting by: variable, spatial domain, vertical dimension, and time of day. This reduces the data volume to 0.3% of it's original size."

    "\n",
    "The second example uses the MERRA-2 product M2T1NXSLV, which contains time-averaged values of 2-dimensional meteorological fields at hourly intervals. For this case, we will create a global daily mean by averaging all the time steps in each granule, and also regrid the result. All the steps in the workflow are the same as those outlined above, except for Steps 4 and 5, which are rewritten below. For this example, the details of the defined parameters that describe the subset are different, and the JSON-formatted subset_request structure is altered to disable the vertical dimension slicing and enable the regridding feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected variables in this example are: total precipitable water vapor (TQV), total precipitable liquid water (TQL), and total precipitable ice water(TQI). The spatial coverage is global, and the date range remains 4-5 January 1980. Because we are working with 2-dimensional data, there is no dimensional subsetting so the dimSlice parameter is omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these hourly data variables are time-averaged instead of instantaneous, the time stamp is in the middle of the hour (00:30Z) instead of at the top of the hour (00:00Z) as in the previous example. Note that the result will have a time stamp of 12:00Z, the mid point of the averaging period. The options for diurnalAggregation are: '1' (daily mean), '2' (daily minimum), and '3' (daily maximum).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also enable the regridding feature by specifying an interpolation method and a destination grid. This regridding service is not available for all GES DISC data products, but it is an option for Level 3 or Level 4 data collections. The options for interpolation methods are: 'remapbil', 'remapbic', 'remapdis', 'remapnn', 'remapcon', 'remapcon2', 'remaplaf'. The options for destination grid are: 'JRA-55', '20cr2x2', 'MERRA1.25', 'gpcp2.5', 'cfsr0.5a', 'cfsr0.5b', 'cfsr1.0', 'cfsr2.5', 'ncepncar2.5', 'geos1x125', 'geos1x1', 'geos4x5', 'geos2x25', 'fv1x125', 'fv2x25', 'fv4x5', 'ERA-40', 'ERA2.5', 'ERA-I', 'ERA1.5', 'ERA.75', 'GPCC2.5', 'GPCC1.0', 'GPCC0.5', 'CMORPH2.5', 'GLDAS-2_1', 'GFDL'.

For this case, we will crop the bounding box with the latitude [-90,0] and longitude [-180,0]. All the steps in the workflow are the same as those outlined above, except for Steps 4 and 5, which are rewritten below. For this example, the details of the defined parameters that describe the subset are different, and the JSON-formatted subset_request structure is altered to disable the vertical dimension slicing and enable the regridding feature.\n",
